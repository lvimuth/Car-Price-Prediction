This is a machine learning project that predicts the prices of used cars based on various features.

**#Car Price Prediction**


This is a machine learning project that predicts the prices of used cars based on various features. The project uses a dataset of car listings scraped from popular car sales websites such as CarGurus, Autotrader, and Cars.com. The dataset includes features such as the car's make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and location.

##The project includes the following components:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The raw data is processed to remove irrelevant information and handle missing values. The data is also transformed and normalized to prepare it for machine learning models.

Exploratory Data Analysis: The data is analyzed to understand the distribution of various features and their relationship with the target variable (car price).

Feature Engineering: New features are created by combining or transforming existing features to improve the predictive power of the models.

Model Training and Evaluation: Various machine learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks are trained and evaluated on the data. The best performing models are selected for deployment.

Model Deployment: The best performing model is deployed as a RESTful API using Flask. The API can be used to make car price predictions for new car listings.

The project is implemented in Python using popular libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. The code is organized into separate Jupyter notebooks for each component and can be easily reproduced and modified.

**#Getting Started**

To get started with the project, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README file. The README file includes details on how to set up the environment, install the required packages, and run the Jupyter notebooks.

**#Contributing**

Contributions to the project are welcome. If you find any issues or have ideas for new features, please create a GitHub issue or submit a pull request.
